# Review Notes

- [x] Ensure melee resources are re-registered after `RunController.restart()` so post-restart runs still process damage (`src/engine/run-controller.ts:271`, `src/combat/melee-system.ts:75`).
- [ ] Plan HUD styling improvements (layout polish, typography, responsive states) before implementing the Milestone B visual pass.
